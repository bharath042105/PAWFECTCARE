        <h1>Pet Hygiene and Grooming Tips</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="tip">
                <h2>Regular Bathing</h2>
                <p>Bathe your pet regularly using a pet-friendly shampoo. The frequency of baths depends on your pet's
                    breed, lifestyle, and skin condition. Over-bathing can strip their skin of natural oils, so aim for
                    a balance.</p>
                <p>For most dogs, a bath every 4-6 weeks is sufficient. However, some breeds with oily coats may require
                    more frequent baths, while others with water-repellent coats should be bathed less often.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="tip">
                <h2>Brushing</h2>
                <p>Brush your pet's coat regularly to remove loose fur, dirt, and tangles. This helps prevent mats and
                    reduces shedding. Use a brush suitable for your pet's coat type, whether it's short, long, curly, or
                    double-coated.</p>
                <p>Brushing your pet's coat not only keeps their fur looking neat but also stimulates blood flow to the
                    skin and distributes natural oils, promoting a healthy and shiny coat.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="tip">
                <h2>Dental Care</h2>
                <p>Dental hygiene is crucial for your pet's overall health. Brush your pet's teeth regularly with a pet
                    toothbrush and toothpaste specifically designed for animals. Dental chews and toys can also help
                    reduce plaque buildup.</p>
                <p>Poor dental hygiene can lead to dental diseases such as tartar buildup, gum inflammation, and tooth
                    decay. Brushing your pet's teeth daily or several times a week can prevent these issues and ensure
                    fresh breath.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="tip">
                <h2>Ear Cleaning</h2>
                <p>Check your pet's ears regularly for signs of dirt, redness, or odor. Clean their ears gently with a
                    veterinarian-approved ear cleaner and cotton balls or pads. Avoid inserting anything into the ear
                    canal.</p>
                <p>Cleaning your pet's ears helps prevent ear infections and removes excess wax and debris. If you
                    notice any abnormalities such as discharge or foul odor, consult your veterinarian for further
                    evaluation.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="tip">
                <h2>Nail Trimming</h2>
                <p>Keep your pet's nails trimmed to a proper length to prevent overgrowth, discomfort, and potential
                    injury. Use pet nail clippers or grinders and be careful not to cut the quick, which contains blood
                    vessels and nerves.</p>
                <p>Regular nail trimming is essential for maintaining your pet's mobility and preventing problems such
                    as ingrown nails and broken nails. If you're unsure how to trim your pet's nails safely, ask your
                    veterinarian or a professional groomer for guidance.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="tip">
                <h2>Eye Care</h2>
                <p>Check your pet's eyes regularly for any signs of redness, discharge, or irritation. Use a damp cloth
                    or cotton ball to gently wipe away any debris from the corners of their eyes.</p>
                <p>Eye problems such as conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, and tear duct blockages can occur in pets. Early
                    detection and proper eye care can help prevent complications and preserve your pet's vision.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="tip">
                <h2>Healthy Diet</h2>
                <p>Provide your pet with a balanced and nutritious diet to support their overall health and coat
                    condition. Consult with your veterinarian to determine the best diet for your pet's specific needs.
                </p>
                <p>A high-quality diet rich in essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals is essential for your pet's
                    well-being. Avoid feeding them table scraps or excessive treats, as these can lead to obesity and
                    other health issues.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="tip">
                <h2>Regular Vet Check-ups</h2>
                <p>Schedule regular veterinary check-ups for your pet to monitor their health, address any grooming
                    concerns, and receive preventive care such as vaccinations and parasite control.</p>
                <p>Regular vet visits are crucial for early detection of health problems and timely intervention. Your
                    veterinarian can also provide personalized advice on grooming, nutrition, and overall pet care.</p>
